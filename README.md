# Overview
A common front-end development task involves inspecting design templates (drafted by the Design team in Adobe XD), then translating those templates into front-end components.

For this assessment, you will be provided a [design template](https://xd.adobe.com/view/4614858b-9a9c-4823-876e-58b84c36082f-1347/specs/) and are tasked to create React components for the two bottom-most blocks that appear in the template: **Customer Reviews** and **Frequently Asked Questions**. You will have 48 hours to complete this from the moment you receive the assessment. Any resources available on the internet can be freely used.

*Hint: Take some time to become familiar with the Adobe XD interface. You can inspect elements to determine their properties.*

Data `data-module.js` and image assets will be provided `assets/images` to you in this repository. You must push your final product to GitHub in order for your work to be evaluated.

# Objectives
* Visit to the following page to view the design template: https://xd.adobe.com/view/4614858b-9a9c-4823-876e-58b84c36082f-1347/specs/
* Create a React component for the **Customer Reviews** block.
  * Content should mirror the content and appearance of the design template block.
  * Stars should populate and fill according to a given rating (e.g., 4.8/5.0).
* Create a React component for the **Frequently Asked Questions** block.
  * Content should mirror the content and appearance of the design template block.
  * Each FAQ item should be an accordion that expands and collapses to reveal or hide additional text.
* Create mobile-responsive design with the given design template: https://xd.adobe.com/view/2d2474d7-8ef0-43aa-b5c0-ad1298c8c551-7877/specs/
  * Your breakpoint should be `850px`.
  * Only the bottom two blocks.
* You are provided with a totally empty React project, use this opportunity to develop, import and render these blocks with the best practices.
